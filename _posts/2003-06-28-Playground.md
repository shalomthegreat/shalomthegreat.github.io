Welcome to my space. I like to create serverless mini-apps for fun, written for the web and contained in a small file that can be saved or transferred. Check out a few of my favorites below...

- Cleanup your favorite blogger recipes; print them on one page without the ads and fluff: [Recipe Formatter](/Recipe.html)
- Track your health and find your hidden food allergies: [Food Journal](/Log.html)
