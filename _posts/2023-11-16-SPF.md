## Step 4 - Activate your green node

After following your standard operating system download process, login with the same credentials used for your free green account. Without a license you can still support the blockchain.

## Step 5 - Earn rewards

GREEN rewards are distributed to the wallets of active node owners who own a mining license, which can be managed in the SetPowerFree app. To purchase a license and access rewards, login into your account through [https://app.setpowerfree.com/login](https://app.setpowerfree.com/login). You will then be prompted to finish wallet set up, and given the option to purchase a license.

**_Pro Tip:_** During this process you will want to make sure to **write down your 12 word pass phrase** & secure it somewhere safe. This process happens once and it is not recoverable. SetPowerFree is a non-custodial wallet.
