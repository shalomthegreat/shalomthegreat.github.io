Hi, I am a software designer and developer, currently living and working in the beautiful Salt Lake valley (a.k.a Silicon Slopes). I moved here from Seattle in 2019. The sunshine, open spaces, and community spirit won over my love of evergreens, and has kept me here for the past 4 years.

# How I got started...

I officially began my software journey in 2018, but I have been a computer nerd ever since I was little. My dad sparked my passion, he humbly encouraged self directed learning, creativity, and exploration into the wide world of computers and networking.

All throughout my teenage years (and even before), I was exploring the world of linux software, windows registry pranks, creating my own windows themes (shoutout to you Vista), upgrading my PC hardware, and building my own websites and small computer applications.

Encouraged by some good friends, I started learning programming languages. I had a lot of fun, but my path was derailed due to various hardships. Collage wasn't an option for me, so I steered my time towards graphic design gigs and website make-overs.

# The adventure begins...

By the time 2018 rolled around, a family friend heard of my interest in programming, what started out as a website re-designed ended in an opportunity to work for his [software company](https://duplimark.com) in Auburn WA. Thanks to my coworkers there, the foundation I had in programming, and the sticking through the hard-times, I got to develop real-work experience through mobile app development and team management.

It wasn't long afterwards that another handful of disasters changed the path I was on, and lead me here to Utah, where my focus was to regain my health and independence. Through a series of radical miracles, I was among the first few devs hired at a blockchain and crypto development company called BlockBot. I have had the privilege of watching the company grow from a handful of devs, to over 150 employees today.
