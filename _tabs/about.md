Hi, I am a software developer who currently lives and works in the beautiful Salt Lake valley. I moved here from Seattle in 2019. The sunshine, open spaces, and community spirit have kept me here for the past 4 years. I never thought I could say goodbye to my northwest evergreens, but the beautiful Wasatch mountains and gorgeous sunsets have been a fair trade&mdash;and the open roads sure help too. ;)

# How I got started...

I officially began my software career in 2018, but I have been a computer nerd ever since I was little. My dad sparked my passion, he humbly encouraged self directed learning, creativity, and exploration into the wide world of computers and networking.

All throughout my teenage years (and even before), I was exploring the world of linux software, windows registry pranks, creating my own windows themes (shoutout to Windows Vista), upgrading my PC hardware, and building my own websites and small computer applications.

Encouraged by some good friends, I started learning programming languages. I started out with C and C++, but my path was derailed due to various family hardships. Collage wasn't an option for me, so I steered my time towards graphic design, video production, and web design (utilizing HTML5, JQuery, and various JS frameworks).

# The adventure begins...

In late 2017, I asked God to open doors for me to pursue my passion. Without a degree, I wasn't sure what was possible, but God sent people to strengthen my faith that He would make a way.

It wasn't long after when a family friend introduced me to his development team and business colleagues. What started out as a website make-over ended in an opportunity to work for their [software company](https://duplimark.com) in early 2018.

During my time there, I was able to develop real-world experience with .NET and C#, building apps for web and mobile. My reputation for quick and efficient work, bug-free code, and task management, landed me a team lead role. By 2019, our team of three devs was so efficient we built a complete social media app in only three months.

# Achievement unlocked...

In 2021 I was among the first few devs hired at a visionary blockchain and crypto incubator called BlockBot. Over the next two years, despite hardships in the economy, we grew from a handful of devs to over 150 employees. As the lead developer for their multi-platform mining software, I had the privilege of helping eight companies launch their own blockchain ecosystem, making them some of the first pioneers of community-driven, decentralized companies known as DAOs.
