Hi, I'm a software engineer who currently lives and works in the beautiful Salt Lake valley. I moved here from Seattle in 2019. The sunshine, open spaces, and community spirit have captured my heart and lead me call this home. I am passionate about blockchain and Web 3.0, as well as AI, user experience, and the importance of using technology in [a sustainable and responsible way](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/2443678-the-role-of-technology-in-sustainable-development).

# How I got started...

<!-- I officially began my software career in 2018, but I have been a computer nerd ever since I was little. My dad sparked my passion, he humbly encouraged self directed learning, creativity, and exploration into the wide world of computers and networking. -->

All throughout my teenage years (and even before), I was exploring the world of linux software, windows registry pranks, creating my own windows themes (shoutout to Windows Vista), upgrading my PC hardware, and building my own websites and small computer applications.

Encouraged by some good friends, I started learning programming languages. I began with C and C++ right after highschool, but my path was derailed due to family hardships. Collage wasn't an option for me, so I steered my time towards a freelancing business, providing local businesses with full-stack web & media solutions (utilizing HTML5, JQuery, Angular, and even custom frameworks).

# The adventure begins...

In late 2017, I asked God to open doors for me to pursue my true passion in software engineering. It wasn't long after, an opportunity opened up at a local startup. What began as a website re-skin ended up as an almost 4 year tenure, revamping and building new products from the ground up. My reputation for quick and efficient work, bug-free code, and efficient task management landed me a lead role. By 2019, our team of three devs was so efficient we built a ground-up social media app for Android and iOS in a record three months. Unfortunately, due to covid losses and rapid changes in the market, the company closed it's doors...

# Achievement unlocked...

In 2021 I was among the first few devs hired at a visionary blockchain and Web3 tech incubator called BlockBot. Over the next two years, we grew from a handful of devs to over 200 employees. As the lead developer for their multi-platform mining software, I was in charge of architecting solutions to the auto-update system, essential for maintaining customer retention, training new employees, and revamping the application to meet demand for a modern dashboard with analytics and reporting. Our customer base grew exponentially and retention was higher than ever.

With a small but mighty team, we launched eight complete blockchain ecosystems for eight companies.
