Hi, I am a software designer and developer.

I am currently living and working in the beautiful Salt Lake valley (a.k.a Silicon Slopes). I moved here from Seattle in 2019. The sunshine, open spaces, and community spirit have graciously kept me here.

# How I got started...

I officially began my software journey in 2018, but I have been a computer nerd ever since I was little. My dad sparked my passion, he humbly encouraged self directed learning, creativity, and exploration into the wide world of computers and networking.

All throughout my teenage years (and even before), I was exploring the world of linux software, windows registry pranks, creating my own windows themes (shoutout to you Vista), upgrading my PC hardware, and building my own websites and small computer applications.

Encouraged by some good friends, I started learning programming languages. I had a lot of fun, but my path was derailed due to various hardships. Collage wasn't an option for me, so I steered my time towards graphic design gigs and website make-overs.

By the time 2017 rolled around, a family friend heard of my interest in programming, and gave me the opportunity to work for his [software company](https://duplimark.com). Thanks to my coworkers there, the encouragement, the opportunities, the sticking through the hard-times, and not a few miracles along the way, I am where I am today...
